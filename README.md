## Assumptions Made
- Since the requirements were simple, there isn't a separate backend for handling API calls. The API calls were done in JS. (I have another project where a similar website was done with HTML frontend and Flask backend. Check it out here - [Repo List](https://github.com/thenithinbalaji/RepoList))
- The `topics` for each repo were assumed to be `the repo's topics + the repo's top language`

## How To Run Locally?
